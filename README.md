Question 4 I did quickly using AI. 
I used examples from my JS base, added it to AI explained what I wanted, gave it the question.

Q 2 & 3 I havent actually done yet. Played with it when i didnt have food but will fix it now that I can concentrate.
Plan to follow something similar for php.
A big consideration to look at for performance, is to include scalability in performance. 
A single page function will always outperform a 12 page app. But to refactor multiple Godlike functions...

NOTA BENA!!
This is a failed test I finished and played around with. At the time I ran out of food when my money ran out and I spent the previous weeks barely eating and a couple weeks in August/September without any food.
So my ability to concentrate and think logically was greatly impaired because of malnutrition and hunger.
Once Im on a steady diet after a few weeks I really come alive and this level of programming is a cinch to me. 

Also I kept the PHP procedural style because of speed, but Im going to play around with it and do it all with both PHP & JS. Then rewrite my log parser a little to exclude the expansion design.
